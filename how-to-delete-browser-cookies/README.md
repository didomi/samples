# How to delete cookies from the browser

Insert the file ```script.js``` of this repository anywhere in your HTML.

This is not a universal recipe that can be applicable the same way in all cases. The script is a standard code that will potentially need to be adapted depending on the configuration and limitations of your particular case. 

The script works on all browsers. It is triggered when a user who had previously agreed to everything changes their choices to refuse everything. In this sense, when a user withdraws their consent, the page will be automatically reloaded and all the cookies that have not been specified in the script will be deleted from the browser.
